   "Often we have to face some type of crisis during our recovery, such as
                         the death of a loved one..."

   Every life has a beginning and an end.  However, when someone we love a
   great deal reaches the end of their life, we may have a very hard time
   accepting their sudden, final absence.  Our grief may be so powerful that
   we fear it will completely overwhelm us-but it will not.  Our sorrow may
   hurt more than anything we can remember, but it will pass.

   We need not run from the emotions that may arise from the death of a loved
   one.  Death and grieving are parts of the fullness of living "life on
   life's terms." By allowing ourselves the freedom to experience these
   feelings, we partake more deeply of both our recovery and our human
   nature.

   Sometimes the reality of another's death makes our own mortality that
   much more pronounced.   We reevaluate our priorities, appreciating the
   loved ones still with us all the more.  Our life, and our life with them,
   will not go on forever.   We want to make the most of what's most
   important while it lasts.

   We might find that the death of someone we love helps strengthen our
   conscious contact with our Higher Power.   If we remember that we can
   always turn to that source of strength when we are troubled, we will be
   able to stay focused on it no matter what may be going on around us.

                           ----=----

   Just for today:   I will accept the loss of one I love and turn to my
   Higher Power for the strength to accept my feelings.  I will make the most
   of my love for those in my life today.
