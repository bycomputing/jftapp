       "The steps offer a big change from a life dominated by guilt and
    remorse.  Our futures are changed because we don't have to avoid those
   who we have harmed.  As a result... we receive a new freedom that can end
                                 isolation."

   Many of us come to Narcotics Anonymous full of regrets about our past.
   Our steps help us begin to resolve those regrets.  We examine our lives,
   admit our wrongs, make amends for them, and sincerely try to change our
   behavior.  In doing so, we find a joyous sense of freedom.

   No longer must we deny or regret our past.  Once we've made our amends,
   what's done is truly over and gone.   From that point on, where we come
   from ceases to be the most important thing about us.  It's where we are
   going that counts.

   In NA, we begin to look forward.  True, we live and stay clean just for
   today.  But we find that we can begin to set goals, dream dreams, and look
   ahead to the joys a life in recovery has to offer.  Looking forward keeps
   us centered in where we are going, not remorseful or regretful about our
   past.  After all, it is hard to move forward if we are looking back.

   Just for today:   The steps have freed me from regrets over my past.
   Today, I look forward to my new life in recovery.
