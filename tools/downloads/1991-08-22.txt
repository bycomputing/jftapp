     "We recognize our spiritual growth when we are able to reach out and
                                help others."

   To make a difference in the world, to contribute something special, is
   perhaps the highest aspiration of the human heart.  Each one of us, no
   matter what our personal makeup, has a unique quality to offer.

   Chances are that at some time in our recovery we met someone who reached
   us when no one else could.  Whether it was someone who made us laugh at
   our first meeting, a warm and compassionate sponsor, or an understanding
   friend who supported us through an emotional storm, that person made all
   the difference in the world.

   All of us have had the gift of recovery shared with us by another
   recovering addict.  For that, we are grateful.  We express our gratitude
   by sharing freely with others what was given to us.   The individual
   message we carry may help a newcomer only we can reach.

   There are many ways to serve our fellowship.  Each of us will find that we
   do some things better than others, but all service work is equally
   important.   If we are willing to serve, we're sure to find that
   particular way to contribute that's right for us.

   Just for today:   My contribution makes a difference.   I  will offer a
   helping hand today.
